# Java EE 8 Samples: JSF 2.3 - Hello world#

The [JSR 372](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=372) specifies the next version of JavaServer Faces - JSF 2.3. 

A very simple example consisting out of a single page, a backing bean and a bean that activates JSF. 
The page prints "Hello world, from JSF!" which comes from the backing bean.
